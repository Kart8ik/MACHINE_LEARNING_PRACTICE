# Machine Learning Repository

This repository serves as a storage space for my Python-based machine learning files, experiments, and notes. It includes scripts, Jupyter notebooks, sample datasets, and trained models that I will later use to build ML projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kart8ik/MACHINE_LEARNING_PRACTICE.git
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
